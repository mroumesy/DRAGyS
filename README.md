*DRAGyS* stands for Disk Ring Adjustment Geometry yields to Scattering phase function. This project aims to extract the Scattering Phase Function (SPF) from protoplanetary disk images. 
Unlike traditional approaches that rely on prior time-consuming disk modeling, *DRAGyS* directly analyzes disk images to estimate their geometry and extract the SPF. 
It also considers geometric effects, like limb brightening, which are often neglected but can significantly impact the derived SPF. This tool represents a significant step forward in studying SPFs from ring-shaped protoplanetary disks.
